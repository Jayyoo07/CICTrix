/**
 * Succession planning — qualification filter and ranking criteria.
 *
 * Two stages, and they are deliberately different in kind:
 *
 *   A. QUALIFICATIONS (filter). Education, Eligibility, Experience and Relevant
 *      Training are minimum requirements. They are NOT weighted and they do not
 *      contribute points — an employee either meets all four and enters the
 *      pool, or fails one and does not.
 *
 *   B. CRITERIA (ranking). Only qualified employees are ranked, on Performance,
 *      Relevant Experience (which includes length of service), Relevant
 *      Training, Education beyond the minimum, and Eligibility beyond the
 *      minimum.
 *
 * The distinction matters: a criterion that gates must never also be scored on
 * whether it gates, or clearing the bar gets paid for twice. Education,
 * Training and Eligibility appear in both stages, but the ranking counts only
 * what is ABOVE the minimum the filter already checked.
 *
 * Kept separate from succession.ts so the rules are testable without a database
 * and reviewable on their own.
